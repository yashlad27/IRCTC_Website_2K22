The railway network of our country is one of the most complex public establishments. You can design a database solution for this network and make the management of the same more natural. Your system should have the following pieces of information:  Station names Tracks that connect those stations (to keep things simple, you can assume that only one track runs between two stations) Train IDs with names Schedules of the trains  The train schedules should have information on the stations from where the train starts and by when it reaches the destination. It should also include information on which stations it passes through during its journey.
